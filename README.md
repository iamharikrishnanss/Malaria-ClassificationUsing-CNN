# Malaria-ClassificationUsing-CNN
# Project Name: MALARIA DETECTION USING BLOOD SMEARS



## Overview: 
In this project we have trained multiple accurate and computationally efficient machine learning models for detection of malaria in images of blood smear cells. We have trained this model using a publicly available malaria dataset. These trained models had an accuracy of 99.23 and this model was deployed in a web application for ease of use.It is conceivable that these contributions can play a significant role towards building a fully automated system for malaria parasite detection in the future.
